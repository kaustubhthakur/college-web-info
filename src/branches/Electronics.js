        <h4 className='content'>
        Electronics and telecommunications engineering is a modern engineering discipline that deals with designing, fabricating, producing, testing and supervising the manufacturing process of complex electronic products and systems. It is a diverse field that encompasses designing and developing traditional analogue technology and high-tech digital components. ETE engineers create many of the devices that we use every day, such as mobile phones, television, radio, personal computers and WiFi networks.

Electronics and telecommunications engineering helps design products in various industries, such as telecommunications, radio and television, healthcare, utilities, science and personal technology manufacturing. ETE engineers deal with analogue transmission, digital transmission, video reception, audio and data, basic electronics, microprocessors, digital and analogue communication, integrated circuits, wave progression and satellite communication. The electronics and telecommunications field is rapidly growing and offers many excellent opportunities for skilled professionals

     <h4 className="content">
     Electronic engineering as a profession sprang from technological improvements in the telegraph industry during the late 19th century and in the radio and telephone industries during the early 20th century. People gravitated to radio, attracted by the technical fascination it inspired, first in receiving and then in transmitting.[2] Many who went into broadcasting in the 1920s had become "amateurs" in the period before World War I.[3] The modern discipline of electronic engineering was to a large extent born out of telephone-, radio-, and television-equipment development and the large amount of electronic-systems development during World War II of radar, sonar, communication systems, and advanced munitions and weapon systems. In the interwar years, the subject was known as radio engineering. The word electronics began to be used in the 1940s[4] In the late 1950s the term electronic engineering started to emerge.

Electronic laboratories (Bell Labs, for instance) created and subsidized by large corporations in the industries of radio, television, and telephone equipment, began churning out a series of electronic advances. The electronics industry was revolutionized by the inventions of the first transistor in 1948, the integrated circuit chip in 1959,[5][6] and the silicon MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) in 1959.[7][8] In the UK, the subject of electronic engineering became distinct from electrical engineering as a university-degree subject around 1960. (Before this time, students of electronics and related subjects like radio and telecommunications had to enroll in the electrical engineering department of the university as no university had departments of electronics. Electrical engineering was the nearest subject with which electronic engineering could be aligned, although the similarities in subjects covered (except mathematics and electromagnetism) lasted only for the first year of three-year courses.)

Electronic engineering (even before it acquired the name) facilitated the development of many technologies including wireless telegraphy, radio, television, radar, computers and microprocessors.
